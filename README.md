# Decision-Tree-prediction-model-for-a-Google-Merchandise-Store

•	Summary:-
	In this project, I have created a Decision tree prediction model for a google merchandise store where it helps to predict whether new visitor will transact or not based on the data given.
•	Mainly 5 steps are followed in this project as follows:-
1.	Importing the libraries
2.	Data Cleaning and Wrangling
3.	Data Visualization
4.	Feature Engineering
5.	Applying Machine Learning Model

	Importing the Libraries: - In this section, I imported the libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Datetime, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	Data Cleaning and Wrangling: - In this section, I firstly converted Visit time column into a particular format. Then I extracted year, month, day, hour, minute from that column and created their new columns. Then I replaced Nan values with 0 in bounces, pageviews and timeonsite columns. Also after that I removed unnecessary columns.
	Data Visualization: - In this section I had used matplotlib to show the whole dataset in picture format.
	Feature Engineering: - In this section, I had extracted features that will be used for prediction model.
	Applying Machine Learning Model: - In this section, I had applied Decision tree prediction model. First of all I split the dataset into training set and testing set in 80:20 ratio. After that I found out the accuracy of my model.
